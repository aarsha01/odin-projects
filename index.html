                    Uhm, this is not a letter, and you know why :). I'm really thankful for you. I don't know if we will last, neither do I know if you will love me the same forever. But I do know I'm very thankful for this very moment. I love you more than ever. My family is very messed up, and I'm really scared about how we will work out. Sometimes I'm confident about Dad, not because I know I can convince him, but because I know I would never leave him, and I would never leave you for him.

                    I love you as a human and a lover, but I love and respect him because he is my father. There are things I would never forgive him for, but I guess many of us have some broken pieces we try to make up together. I can never hate him as I remember his love for me, but neither do I fully love him. Maybe I'm a bad daughter for that, at least not an ideal one. But whenever I break down, I'm more courageous now than I have ever been. Maybe because, in my heart, I know I have you. I know even if I don’t have u, I'll still pick myself up and be strong, but I'm so grateful to have you that today I lost my sleep and want you to know it through this gift. It’s 4:33 AM, by the way. I love this feeling of being able to rely on someone emotionally a little bit, maybe more than a little bit, hehe. I get this feeling of being protected that I never had, and in words, I can never ever explain how much courage that gives me. I want you to know as long as you don’t cheat on me and we stay the same with each other, I’d love you the same. I know maybe you don’t need this protection like I do, but please know that whether you weigh 200 kg or 50 kg, you could become bald and broke, but I’d still love you.
                    
                    I WOULD love you like crazy. I DO love you like crazy. Maybe I'm not stronger than you, but I’ll protect you when I have to. I’ll be there taking care of you when you're sick, but yeah, obviously I’d be screaming that you wouldn’t have fallen sick if you had listened to me. I love you more than ever just now, and no, it has never decreased a bit but keeps exponentially increasing, making me crazy enough to lose sleep and daydream about our future.
                    
                    I really wish for once God just hears me out, for once God gives me what I love, for once I live with it happily. For once, I’m with the people I love without losing them in any way. For once, God, let me hold on to you. I really hope God, just this once, hears my plea to let us just work out. Not just work out, but work out happily. Just once, let the fairy tales I heard in childhood be true and “happily ever after” exist, just exist. I wouldn’t complain if I died young if I could have this from God. I haven't complained to God about anything yet because I always had some hope that things would change. Sure, I break down during bad times, but never have I ever blamed or complained about it to God. Oh neither would i ever complain about anything else, if this just happens. for just once, i really want to believe that dreams do come true. 
                    
                    I know i'm annoying, get mad at u, don't appreciate ur web designs but i love u insanely and i'm working on myself to be a better gf for u ...coz u definetly deserve the best
                    but i'll be the best for you.
